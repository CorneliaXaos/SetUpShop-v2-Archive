# SetUpShop-v2-Archive

This repo is a (somewhat active, kinda) archive of an installation "script" that is most responsible for inspiring a more ambitious project I'm calling "Set Up Shop".  This particular archive is FUNCTIONAL (at least on Ubuntu) and EXTENSIBLE.  I may more may not accept pull requests that extend the archive of installable packages or adds features as I plan to make a more reasonable (read sane) version later that doesn't rely entirely on shell scripting and may even be portable enough to work on other Operating Systems besides Linux!  Don't hold your breath, though, I don't know when I'll get to it. :P

To see the devil that spawned this demonic script, take a look at [SetUpShop-v1-Archive.](1)  Eventually I'll have a link here to version 3 of the program.. which should no longer be a shell-script of DOOM.
